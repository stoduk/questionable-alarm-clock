# Questionable Alarm Clock
An Arduino powered alarm clock that forces you to answer simple maths question to shut it up.

I was going through a period where I couldn't get out of bed for the life of me - sane me would set the alarm the night before with all intention of waking up on time the next day, but sleepy me sabotaged things by turning the alarm off without questioning whether that was a good idea.  It got to the point where I wouldn't even remember turning the alarm off, it was such an unconscious thing.

I found the only guarantees to get me up were a) knowing I had to catch a flight, b) having to run down to the door to grab an exciting parcel from the postman, c) having to answer the phone.

So clearly I needed something that wouldn't let sleepy me mindlessly shut it up, but instead I would be kept awake long enough while trying to silence it that sleepy me was replaced me sane me and I could get up.
